> This project is created to share Reworth's Directory component.

 Guide for building process: 
	Boilerplate and tutorial [here](https://dev.to/cjinghong/publishing-your-first-react-component-to-npm-7bb)

## Guide
1. Clone this project.
2. Run npm install to set up everything.
3. Create an .env file in the root of the project and add the variables 	listed on .env.example. If some variable is missing the build process 		will fail.
4. Building your component by running `npm build` in your command line. 	This would generate the folder `/lib` which includes Directory component.
5. To test the library on a local project, follow [Step #5](https://dev.to/cjinghong/publishing-your-first-react-component-to-npm-7bb) of the tutorial.
6. Import Directory component on your project as follows:

    Import Directory from "reworth-directory-component";
7. Keep on improving and building :hammer_and_wrench: :man_technologist:
